# Classification of Handwritten Numbers

This project focuses on the classification of handwritten numbers using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for building and training a model to recognize digits, such as those found in the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare the dataset for training.
- **Model Design**: Implementation of a classification model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Techniques to optimize the model and evaluate its performance.
- **Visualization**: Visual tools to inspect the model’s predictions and learning curves.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9):
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas 

## Project Overview
1. **Data Loading**: Import and preprocess the handwritten digit data.
2. **Model Architecture**: Build a deep learning model using fully connected layers or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
3. **Training**: Train the model using appropriate optimization techniques.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy and analyze predictions.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achiving almost 94% accuracy.
